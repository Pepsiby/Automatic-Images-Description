# Automatic-Images-Description
Automatic Image description generate using Hugging Face

I use midjourney to create images for stocking photo. The problem is everytime I download the images, the name appear to contain bunch of words and number that does not need and have no meaning. For instance "A_surprise_Valentines_Day_proposal_a_moment_of_pure__21c201cd-c6dc-4ee1-bf29-ee4af622d3ad_3" Also, I have to input the description in the images metadata, which can take up your time if you have bunch of images.


Step
1. Clone this repository
2. Open up a notepad or text file
3. write the following
@echo
"Your python path" "This python script path"
pause

4. Save this file as .bat
5. Put this file in the same location as your images that you want to change the image
6. Double click on it to run

Note: The file title will also be in the image description metadata
